1st thing I did was fixed the Website name in the top tab.
2nd thing I did was gave all the <h2> a class=""
3rd thing I did was added service inside the ""
4th thing i did was fix the HTML so me and others can read it at maybe first glance.
5th thing i did was took away the </image> there was no need. 
The ending just needed a >.
6th thing i did was fixed on the seo. there was a bug at the end of line 15. so i deleated the n.
7th I also addad a #id attribute inside of class="" to to match inside the SEO link, in the href element.
8th i cleaned up css codes to look better
