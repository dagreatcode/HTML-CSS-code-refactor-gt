This website is ready
Make sure you view this image for better understanding.

1st thing I did was fixed the Website name in the top tab.
2nd thing I did was gave all the <h2> a class=""
3rd thing I did was added service inside the ""
4th thing i did was fix the HTML so me and others can read it at maybe first glance.
5th thing i did was took away the </image> there was no need. The ending just needed a >.

Here is the before
<img src="./assets/images/ScreenShot.png" alt="ScreenShot" />

And Here is the after
<img src="./assets/images/ScreenShot2.png" alt="ScreenShot2" />
